The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
- Make sure to add `username` and `password` for database in `settings.py`

(mozio-env)$ cd mozio-test
(mozio-env)$ python manage.py migrate
(mozio-env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
